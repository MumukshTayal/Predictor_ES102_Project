# Predictor_ES102_Project
Project on Heart Disease predictor through machine learning using sklearn library of python

Additional libraries used in this project are: 1)sklearn 2)pandas 3)matplotlib

Files uploaded to the repository: 1)ES102_Project.py 2)ES102_Project.ipynb 3)heart.csv
File (1) is the regular .py file of the code, File (2) is the .ipynb file which can be directly uploaded to google colab to run the program (Preferred method as this method doesn't require to install libraries), File (3) is the .csv file which stores the dataset from which data is retrieved to run the project successfully.
